      <description>This pages contains a collection of small-size programming projects suitable for students who have just completed an introductory programming course. There is no specific programming language requirement. But, you should adopt the language that is the most comfortable for you. Each project is some simpler version of an existing application. Unlike typical programming assignments, you have to also come up with the exact specification for these programs. I list some issues that you have to handle in specification and functionality that you may need from libraries to implement the program.</description>

      <description>The programming language Python is a popular fixture in introductory programming courses. The adoption of Python as a programming language for introductory courses is mainly driven by two reasons:
Popularity in scientific computing and software industry. Readability. While the first point is irrefutable, the readability enabled by Python&amp;rsquo;s surface-level syntax does not compensate for its many violations of certain fundamental principles related to programming language and user interface design. In this article, we look at certain common problems with Python faced by beginning programmers and will see how a programming language with a better design, OCaml, avoids or even completely prevents these issues.</description>
