  <h1>Tic-tac-toe</h1>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Tic-tac-toe</a> is a well-known two-player game played on a 3x3 board. It is easy to write a program that computes an optimal move at a given board position using plain recursion. However, this approach is too inefficient for a 4x4 board. For a 4x4 board, the simplest algorithm that will work well is to precompute a best move at each position. For this, we need to estimate the number of valid board positions during a game. The valid board positions are determined from the following rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;X&rsquo; makes the first move.</li>
<li>Game is finished when either player has won or the board is full.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these rules, we have at most \(10^7\) valid board positions for the 4x4 game. Assuming we use a byte to store an optimal move from any position, this means we use at most 10MB of storage for the precomputed table.</p>
<p>We also need a mechanism to compute an index into this precomputed table for fast lookup. The most straight-forward way to map a board position into an index is to encode the board using a ternary representation. We can encode a blank by 0, &lsquo;X&rsquo; by 1, and &lsquo;O&rsquo; by 2. If we use this index to encode into the array, we can limit the array size to 43046721 which is 44MB of storage.</p>
<p>The above strategy wastes about eighty percent of storage allocated. A more complex indexing strategy is implied by the following upper-bound on the number of valid boards. Suppose \(x\) &lsquo;X&rsquo; marks have been placed. Then, the number of &lsquo;O&rsquo; marks is \(x\) or \(x-1\). This count is given by \(\binom{16}{x}(\binom{16-x}{x-1} + \binom{16-x}{x})\). Summing over all possibilities for \(x\) from 0 to 8 gives 10165779. With this indexing strategy, we use only 11MB of storage.</p>
<p>In the table below, we compare these strategies for indexing for kxk boards, N is the number of valid positions, B is the size of the array when we encode boards as ternary numbers, C is the encoding using the sum and product rule in counting.</p>
